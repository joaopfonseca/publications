# Research Trends and Applications of Data Augmentation Algorithms

## Abstract

In the Machine Learning research community, there is a consensus regarding the
relationship between model complexity and the required amount of data and
computation power. In real world applications, these computational
requirements are not always available, motivating research on regularization
methods. In addition, current and past research have shown that simpler
classification algorithms can reach state-of-the-art performance on computer
vision tasks given a robust method to artificially augment the training
dataset. Because of this, data augmentation techniques became a popular
research topic in recent years. However, existing data augmentation methods
are generally less transferable than other regularization methods. In this
paper we identify the main areas of application of data augmentation
algorithms, the types of algorithms used, significant research trends, their
progression over time and research gaps in data augmentation literature. To do
this, the related literature was collected through the Scopus database. Its
analysis was done following network science, text mining and exploratory
analysis approaches. We expect readers to understand the potential of data
augmentation, as well as identify future research directions and open
questions within data augmentation research.
