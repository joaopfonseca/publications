\subsection{Experimental Data}~\label{sec:experimental_data}

The datasets used in this experiment were extracted from the
\href{https://archive.ics.uci.edu}{UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository}. All
of the datasets are publicly available and cover a range of different domains.
The selection of datasets was done to ensure that all datasets are imbalanced
and contained non-metric features (\textit{i.e.}, whether ordinal, nominal or
binary). These datasets will be used to show how the performance of different
classifiers varies according to the used over/undersampling method.

At an initial stage, all datasets were preprocessed manually with minimal
manipulations, to avoid the application of preprocessing methods beyond the
scope of this paper. This step was conducted to remove features and/or
observations with missing values and identifying the non-metric features. The
second stage of our

\section{Results and Discussion}~\label{sec:results_and_discussion}

In this section we present the experimental results. We focus on the
comparison of classification performance using oversamplers whose generation
mechanism is compatible with datasets containing both continuous and
categorical features.

\subsection{Results}~\label{sec:results}

Table~\ref{tbl:mean_sem_ranks} presents the mean rankings of cross validation
scores across the different combinations of oversamplers, metrics and
classifiers. These results were calculated by assigning a ranking score for
each oversampler from 1 (best) to 4 (worst) for each dataset, metric and
classifier, based on the results reported in Table~\ref{tbl:wide_optimal} (See
Appendix).

\input{../analysis/mean_sem_ranks.tex}

Table~\ref{tbl:mean_sem_scores} presents the mean cross validation scores.
With exception to the OA metric, G-SMOTENC either outperformed or matched the
the remaining oversamplers.

\subsection{Statistical Analysis}~\label{sec:statistical_analysis}

The statistical analysis was developed using exclusively imbalance-appropriate
metrics: F-Score and G-Mean.
