Abstract
========

In remote sensing, Active Learning (AL) has become an important technique to
collect informative ground truth data "on-demand" for supervised
classification tasks. In spite of its effectiveness, it is still significantly
reliant on user interaction, which makes it both expensive and time consuming
to implement. Most of the current literature focuses on the optimization of AL
by modifying the selection criteria and the classifiers used. Although
improvements in these areas will result in more effective data collection, the
use of artificial data sources to reduce human-computer interaction remains
unexplored. In this paper, we introduce a new component to the typical AL
framework, the data generator, a source of artificial data to reduce the
amount of user-labeled data required in AL\@. The implementation of the
proposed AL framework is done using Geometric SMOTE as data generator. We
compare the new AL framework to the original one using similar acquisition
functions and classifiers over three AL-specific performance metrics in seven
benchmark datasets. We show that this modification of the AL framework
significantly reduces cost and time requirements for a successful AL
implementation in all of the datasets used in the experiment.
