## Abstract

In spite of its importance in sustainable resource management, the automatic production of Land
Use/Land Cover maps continues to be a challenging problem. The ability to build robust automatic
classifiers able to produce accurate maps can have a significant impact in the way we manage and
optimize natural resources. The difficulty in achieving these results comes from many different
factors, such as data quality and uncertainty, among others. In this paper, we address the
imbalanced learning problem, a common and difficult problem in remote sensing that affects the
quality of classifiers. Having very asymmetric distributions of the different classes constitutes a
significant hurdle for any classifier. In this work, we propose Geometric-SMOTE as a means of
addressing the imbalanced learning problem in remote sensing. Geometric-SMOTE is a sophisticated
oversampling algorithm which increases the quality of the generated instances over previous methods,
such as Synthetic Minority Oversampling TEchnique. The performance of Geometric-SMOTE, in the the
LUCAS dataset, is compared to other oversamplers using a variety of classifiers. The results show
that Geometric-SMOTE significantly outperforms all the other oversamplers and improves the
robustness of the classifiers. These results indicate that, when using imbalanced datasets, remote
sensing researchers should consider the use of these new generation oversamplers to increase the
quality of the classification results.
